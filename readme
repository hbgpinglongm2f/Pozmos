pozmos is currently undergoing a re-evaluation and rethink, so actual development will be on hold for now.

any questions, create an issue.

for now, the current release will be available at https://files.catbox.moe/boo4aq.7z and will have the various homebrew components updated on a sort-of-regular basis. (iow, when I can summon enough shits to give) until I have the better method in place.

the linked version has atmosphere 0.8.9, and a very slimmed down set of essential utilities. fully compatible with 8.0.1 and earlier (sysmodules may not work on earlier firmwares).

* tinfoil-88 (last known working version of og tinfoil, solid USB installer for most games)
* goldleaf 0.5 (less solid USB installer for games that may be too new for tinfoil-88)
* nx-shell 1.20 (file manager)
* edizon 3.0.1 (save manager, cheats)
* hb appstore

Instructions
1. Simply extract to the root of the sd card (move your existing CFW into a backup folder if you have one set up already), all you should have on the sd before extracting pozmos is the Nintendo folder.

hello idiots of /r/switchpirates!
